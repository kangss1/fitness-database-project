# Phase 2: Normalization

### Objective
This phase focuses on applying **normalization principles** to refine the database design and eliminate redundancy. The schema created in Phase 1 is adjusted for efficiency and consistency.

### Key Activities
- Converted the proposed design to **First (1NF), Second (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
- Ensured that all attributes depend only on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.
- Defined **primary and foreign keys** for all entities.
- Revised **relationships** to reflect functional dependencies correctly.

### Deliverables
- Updated list of tables and attributes.
- Normalization report showing step-by-step reduction to 3NF.
- Documentation of data dependencies.

### Learning Goals
- Apply normalization theory to a practical database problem.
- Improve logical schema quality and query efficiency.
- Reinforce the connection between relational theory and design implementation.
