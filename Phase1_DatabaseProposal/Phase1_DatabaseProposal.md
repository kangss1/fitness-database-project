# Phase 1: Database Proposal

### Objective
In this phase, the project begins with a **conceptual database design proposal** for a fitness tracking system. The focus is on defining the purpose of the database, its intended users, and how it supports fitness data tracking and analysis.

### Deliverables
- **Project Description:** Overview of the fitness database concept and scope.
- **Entities and Attributes:** Identification of key entities such as users, workouts, exercises, and progress.
- **Business Rules:** Description of how the data should interact and constraints that maintain data integrity.
- **Sample Queries (in plain English):** Examples of questions the database should be able to answer (e.g., “Which exercises burn the most calories per session?”).

### Learning Goals
- Understand the initial steps of relational database planning.
- Translate real-world problems into structured data models.
- Apply early-stage entity analysis and rule formulation.
