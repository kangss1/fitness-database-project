# Phase 4: Database Implementation

### Objective
This final phase focuses on **building and testing the database** using SQL in phpMyAdmin. It consolidates all earlier design stages into a working database.

### Deliverables
1. **Database Tables**
   - All entities from the ERD created and linked with primary and foreign keys.
   - Sample data inserted for testing.
2. **Views and Triggers**
   - Two database views created for simplifying complex queries.
   - One meaningful trigger implemented to automate data management.
3. **Queries**
   - Nine total queries showcasing joins, aggregation, and logical conditions.
   - Each query designed to meet a specific business need.
4. **Exported Database**
   - Full `.sql` export of the implemented schema and data.

### Learning Goals
- Apply SQL syntax to create a relational database from a logical design.
- Demonstrate database testing and validation using queries.
- Implement automation using triggers and optimization through views.
