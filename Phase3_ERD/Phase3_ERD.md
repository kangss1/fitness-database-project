# Phase 3: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### Objective
This phase visualizes the finalized database structure through an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**. The ERD connects the theoretical design to its relational schema implementation.

### Key Components
- Entities include:
  - `User`, `Workout`, `Exercise`, `Equipment`, `Goal`, `ProgressEntry`
- Relationships show:
  - One-to-many and many-to-many connections among users, workouts, and exercises.
- Attributes identify keys, data types, and cardinalities.

### Deliverables
- Full ERD diagram illustrating all entities and relationships.
- Table relationship descriptions (primary/foreign keys).
- Documentation of referential integrity rules.

### Learning Goals
- Understand database visualization and how to interpret an ER diagram.
- Communicate database structure clearly for future implementation.
- Validate design consistency before implementation.
